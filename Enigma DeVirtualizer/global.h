/*
The Enigma Protector v2.x - v3.x 32bit Devirtualizer
This tool is designed to translate the virtual opcodes of the Enigma
VM back to normal x86 Code.

Author: DizzY_D & Raham
Version: 1.4

f0Gx, n0p0x90, BlackBerry for all their great support

Usage:
Load the DLL into the target's process space.
For the first (Enigma internal) VM use the "InnerDevirtualize" function
exported by this DLL.
For the second (SDK) VM use the "OuterDevirtualize" function exported by
this DLL and pass a pointer to the bytecode as a parameter.
The VM code should now automatically be fixed and run completely
independent from the Enigma VM.

Notes:
This was one of my first c++ projects so please don't expect super
perfect code. I also didn't implement exception handling and such, but 
now it's open source, so why not implementing it yourself?
It would be nice to see if someone would take up this project and prepare
it for future versions of Enigma.
